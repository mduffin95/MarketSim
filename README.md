##Implementation Notes

###Week 1 - 8th - 14th Feb
Got the basic simulator working. Could add fixed latency to all packets. Implemented ZI-C and ZI-U traders. 
###Week 2 - 15th - 21st Feb
Agents were previously instantly notified when they traded. Now it is sent as a packet as with all other information. 
Added ability for trading agents to handle price updates.
